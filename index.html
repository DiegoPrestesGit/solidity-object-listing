        <p>
          I mainly research topics related to computer architecture and
          programming language design and implementation. However, I have been
          working as an executive or management consultant at several companies
          since before I go with them, maybe partly because my family line is
          that of a manager. Therefore, I have a wide and deep perspective on
          the different elements of a software engineer, management consultant,
          entrepreneur and investor. These assets are very powerful for any team
          working on a unique, massive and complex project.
